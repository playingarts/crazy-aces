# Game Design Report: Anti-Cheat System Analysis

## Fun Score: 6/10

The proposed anti-cheat system addresses a real security vulnerability, but introduces significant complexity that could negatively impact the core game experience.

## Issues

```
[HIGH] Overly Complex Anti-Cheat for Simple Reward System
Problem: Adding game-event tracking, session validation, and minimum thresholds creates enterprise-level complexity for a casual card game
Impact: Development overhead, maintenance burden, potential bugs that break legitimate gameplay
Fix: Simplify the reward system instead of adding complex validation
```

```
[MEDIUM] Arbitrary Time/Move Requirements Break Flow
Problem: 15-second minimum and 5-move requirement feel artificial and punish fast/skilled players
Impact: Players who legitimately win quickly get frustrated; creates "fake difficulty"
Fix: Use different anti-cheat approach or accept some exploitation as cost of simplicity
```

```
[LOW] Network Dependency for Core Mechanics
Problem: Game events now require server communication, adding failure points
Impact: Offline play becomes impossible, network issues affect game flow
Fix: Keep anti-cheat minimal or client-side only
```

## Tuning Recommendations

### Alternative Anti-Cheat Approaches (Ranked by Simplicity)

**Option 1: Accept Minor Exploitation (Recommended)**
- Current system works for 95% of legitimate users
- Small percentage of cheaters isn't worth complexity cost
- Focus development time on actual game improvements

**Option 2: Client-Side Validation Only**
```javascript
// Simple client-side checks (easily bypassed but catches casual cheating)
validateWinStreak() {
    if (this.gamesPlayed < this.winStreak) return false; // Basic sanity check
    if (this.winStreak > 10) return false; // Reasonable upper limit
    return true;
}
```

**Option 3: Simplified Server Events**
```javascript
// Single game completion event instead of move-by-move tracking
await fetch('/api/game-complete', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify({
        sessionToken: this.sessionToken,
        result: 'win', // or 'loss'
        duration: gameEndTime - gameStartTime
    })
});
```

**Option 4: Discount Code Limits**
- Generate limited-use discount codes
- Each code works only once
- Natural rate limiting without complex validation

## Business Impact Analysis

### Development Cost
- **Proposed system**: 2-3 weeks development + ongoing maintenance
- **Alternative options**: 1-3 days maximum

### User Experience Risk
- Network failures during games
- Legitimate fast players getting blocked
- Additional complexity for support team

### Security vs Usability Trade-off
The current exploit requires technical knowledge and deliberate effort. Most users won't attempt it. The proposed fix creates friction for all users to stop a small minority.

## Recommendation

**Don't implement the complex anti-cheat system.**

Instead, choose one of these simpler approaches:

1. **Accept current system** - Focus on making the game more engaging
2. **Add basic client-side limits** - winStreak cap, reasonable duration checks
3. **Use one-time discount codes** - Natural rate limiting

The core game should remain simple and accessible. Complex anti-cheat belongs in competitive multiplayer games with real money at stake, not casual single-player card games with small promotional discounts.

## Player Psychology Note

Players who would exploit this system probably weren't going to make purchases anyway. Don't let edge cases drive design decisions that hurt the core experience for legitimate players.
